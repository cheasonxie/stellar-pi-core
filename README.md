# Hyper-Tech Pi Ecosystem Super App

This repository has been upgraded to a Stablecoin-Only Pi Ecosystem super app, designed for autonomously building, managing, and running internal PI-exclusive applications on Raspberry Pi. All transactions use PI Coin with a fixed value of $314,159, sourced only from mining, contribution rewards, and P2P. The system automatically rejects volatile technologies, external blockchains, and **absolutely no gambling applications**.

## Features
- Autonomous Hyper Intelligence AI (AHI AI) for real-time filtering.
- PI Stablecoin Manager for secure transactions.
- Autonomous App Builder (no gambling apps).
- Hyper Ecosystem Monitor with holographic dashboards.
- Quantum Security Layer for threat protection.
- Ultimate Integration Core for orchestration.
- Final Hyper Expansion Module for global scaling.
- PI Purity Enforcer: Rejects exchange/bought/entered/unclear PI.
- Global PI Oracle for compliance verification.
- Ultimate AI Governance: Ethical, anti-gambling oversight.
- Eternal Guardian: Zero-crime, founder-proof.
- Master Control: One-click ecosystem boot.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stellar-pi-core.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run deployment: `python src/hyper_core/ultimate_deployment_script.py`

## Usage
- Start with Master Control: `python src/hyper_core/master_control_final_integration_script.py`
- All apps are PI-exclusive and gambling-free.

## Compliance
- Stablecoin-Only: Only PI from allowed sources.
- No Gambling: Automatic rejection and ethical audits.
- Zero-Crime: Quantum security and eternal seals.
- Founder-Proof: Freezes/returns PI on manipulations.

## License
MIT - PI Exclusive.

Stellar-core is a replicated state machine that maintains a local copy of a cryptographic ledger and processes transactions against it, in consensus with a set of peers.
It implements the [Stellar Consensus Protocol](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/src/scp/readme.md), a _federated_ consensus protocol.
It is written in C++17 and runs on Linux, OSX and Windows.
